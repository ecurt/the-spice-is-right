# Application Name:
The Spice is Right

# Application Description:
The Spice is Right is a recipe book that provides outstanding seafood recipes. Unlike You Suck At Cooking, we don't shame users, and at the same time we focus on seafood such that the users who are interested in cooking seafood are more interested. We also do not encourage users to use sharp tools unlike our direct competitor The Drunken Cookbook.
Our project will allow users to input recipes and search recipes. We will have a database of our own recipes and allow logged-in users to enter their own recipes. Our application has a focus for seafood based recipes. We will have a section for fish fun facts in all sea-food recipes because it is fun to learn about the fish you are eating. Fish are so cool (literally because most are cold-blooded)!
	Users will be able to search for specific types of recipes they are looking for and within the search bar, they will have the option to search for types of sea life they want to eat. For example, a user can search for “pasta” or they can search for “lobster.” Lobster pasta would show up under both searches. Lobsters have two stomachs, it would be amazing if humans could have two stomachs to eat all the recipes we provide.

# Vision Statement:
To provide recipes for all. Especially for those who are fish-lovers. 

# Development Methodology:
We will use an Agile Methodology. 

# Communication Plan:
We will primarily communicate on Discord.

# Meeting Plan:
We will meet with the TA Mondays at 8pm on zoom.
Our group will meet on our own Thursdays at 11am (before lab).
